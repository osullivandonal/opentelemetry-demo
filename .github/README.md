The following guide describes how to setup the OpenTelemetry demo with Elastic Observability using [Docker compose](#docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](#kubernetes). This fork introduces several changes to the agents used in the demo:

- The Java agent within the [Ad](../src/ad/Dockerfile.elastic), the [Fraud Detection](../src/fraud-detection/Dockerfile.elastic) and the [Kafka](../src/kafka/Dockerfile.elastic) services have been replaced with the Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry Java Agent. You can find more information about the Elastic distribution in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-distribution-opentelemetry-java-agent).
- The .NET agent within the [Cart service](../src/cart/src/Directory.Build.props) has been replaced with the Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry .NET Agent. You can find more information about the Elastic distribution in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-dotnet-applications).
- The Elastic distribution of the OpenTelemetry Node.js Agent has replaced the OpenTelemetry Node.js agent in the [Payment service](../src/payment/package.json). Additional details about the Elastic distribution are available in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-node-js).
- The Elastic distribution for OpenTelemetry Python has replaced the OpenTelemetry Python agent in the [Recommendation service](../src/recommendation/requirements.txt). Additional details about the Elastic distribution are available in [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/observability-labs/blog/elastic-opentelemetry-distribution-python).
- The [Product Reviews service](../src/product-reviews/) uses the vanilla OpenTelemetry Python SDK with auto-instrumentation, including the [OpenAI instrumentation](https://pypi.org/project/opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai-v2/) for capturing GenAI semantic conventions when calling the LLM service.
- The [LLM service](../src/llm/) is intentionally not instrumented, it simulates a third-party LLM API (OpenAI-compatible) and is treated as a black box, as real LLM providers would be.

Additionally, the OpenTelemetry Contrib collector has also been changed to the [Elastic OpenTelemetry Collector distribution](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/blob/main/internal/pkg/otel/README.md). This ensures a more integrated and optimized experience with Elastic Observability.

## Docker

### Prerequisites:

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Automated Installation

1. Sign up for a free trial on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and depending on the deployment type choose the following:
    - Elastic Cloud Hosted (ECH): In the "solution view" select "Elastic for Observability". Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
    - Serverless: In the "choose type" choose the "Elastic for Observability" type. Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
2. Copy the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT URL.
3. Click "Create an API Key" to create one.
4. Run `./demo.sh docker`

### Self-Hosted with start-local

For local development without Elastic Cloud, use [start-local](https://github.com/elastic/start-local) 
to run Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the EDOT Collector locally.

1. Start the Elastic stack with EDOT:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh -s -- --edot
   ```
2. Start the demo in self-hosted mode:
   ```bash    
   ./demo.sh docker self-hosted
   ```
3. Access:
   - Demo: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Kibana: `http://localhost:5601` (credentials shown by start-local)

4. Clean-up:
   - `./demo.sh destroy docker`
   - `./elastic-start-local/stop.sh`
   - `./elastic-start-local/uninstall.sh`

This works by using the demo's EDOT Collector as a gateway that forwards telemetry to the start-local EDOT Collector, which then exports to Elasticsearch.

### Upstream Mode (No EDOT)

For users who do not want to use the Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (EDOT), while still sending telemetry to Elastic:

1. Sign up for a free trial on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and depending on the deployment type choose the following:
    - Elastic Cloud Hosted (ECH): In the "solution view" select "Elastic for Observability". Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
    - Serverless: In the "choose type" choose the "Elastic for Observability" type. Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
2. Copy the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT URL.
3. Click "Create an API Key" to create one.
4. Run the demo in upstream mode:
   ```bash
   ./demo.sh docker upstream
   ```
5. Access the demo at `http://localhost:8080`

This mode uses the standard OpenTelemetry Collector contrib image with OTLP HTTP export configured for Elastic, 
rather than the EDOT collector, also we do not use EDOT SDKs either, here we use the OTel SDKs to instrument services. All telemetry (traces, metrics, logs) is routed to Elastic via OTLP.

> **Note**: This mode has been tested with [upstream release 2.2.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/releases/tag/2.2.0). Some Elastic dashboards may not be fully populated compared to EDOT mode. For general demo documentation, see the [upstream docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/).

### Connect to a local Elasticsearch cluster
The following steps shows how to start the Otel demo in a Docker container and send the generated otel data to an Elasticsearch instance running locally on the host.

1. Create an API key
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9200/_security/api_key" -u USER:PASSWORD -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d'{ "name": "my_api_key" }'
```

2. Update `.env.overide` with URL and API key:
```yml
ELASTIC_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://host.docker.internal:9200"
ELASTIC_OTLP_API_KEY="<api key obtained in step 2>"
```
3. Start the Otel demo in a Docker container:

```sh
make start
```

## Kubernetes
### Prerequisites:
- Create a Kubernetes cluster. There are no specific requirements, so you can create a local one, or use a managed Kubernetes cluster, such as [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), or [AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service).
- Set up [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/).
- Set up [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

### Automated Installation

1. Sign up for a free trial on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and depending on the deployment type choose the following:
    - Elastic Cloud Hosted (ECH): In the "solution view" select "Elastic for Observability". Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
    - Serverless: In the "choose type" choose the "Elastic for Observability" type. Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
2. Copy the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT URL.
3. Click "Create an API Key" to create one.
4. Run `./demo.sh k8s`

### Upstream Mode (No EDOT)

For users who do not want to use the Elastic Distribution of OpenTelemetry (EDOT), while still sending telemetry to Elastic:

1. Sign up for a free trial on [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and depending on the deployment type choose the following:
    - Elastic Cloud Hosted (ECH): In the "solution view" select "Elastic for Observability". Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
    - Serverless: In the "choose type" choose the "Elastic for Observability" type. Once that builds select Add data then Application and finally OpenTelemetry.
2. Copy the OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT URL.
3. Click "Create an API Key" to create one.
4. Run the demo in upstream mode:
   ```bash
   ./demo.sh k8s upstream
   ```

This mode uses the standard OpenTelemetry Collector contrib image with OTLP HTTP export configured for Elastic, 
rather than the EDOT collector, also we do not use EDOT SDKs either, here we use the OTel SDKs to instrument services. All telemetry (traces, metrics, logs) is routed to Elastic via OTLP.

> **Note**: This mode has been tested with [upstream release 2.2.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo/releases/tag/2.2.0). Some Elastic dashboards may not be fully populated compared to EDOT mode. For general demo documentation, see the [upstream docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/).

### Manual Installation

<details>

- Follow the [EDOT Quick Start Guide](https://elastic.github.io/opentelemetry/quickstart/) for Kubernetes and your specific Elastic deployment to install the EDOT OpenTelemetry collector.
- Deploy the Elastic OpenTelemetry Demo using the following command.
  ```
  helm install my-otel-demo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo --version 0.38.3 -f kubernetes/elastic-helm/demo.yml
  ```

</details>

#### Enabling Browser Traffic Generation

In the installed configuration, browser-based load generation is disabled by default to avoid CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues when sending telemetry data from simulated browser clients to the OpenTelemetry Collector. If you'd like to enable browser traffic in the load generator again:

1. Set LOCUST_BROWSER_TRAFFIC_ENABLED to "true" in kubernetes/elastic-helm/demo.yml.
2. Modify the OTLP HTTP receiver in the DaemonSet OpenTelemetry Collector values file (used in the [EDOT Quick Start Guide](https://elastic.github.io/opentelemetry/quickstart/)) to include CORS support:
   ```yaml
   receivers:
     otlp:
       protocols:
         http:
           cors:
             allowed_origins:
               - http://frontend-proxy:8080
   ```
   This configuration allows the OTLP HTTP endpoint to accept trace data from browser-based sources running at http://frontend-proxy:8080.
3. Upgrade the EDOT Quick Start deployment.

## Exploring the Demo

### What the demo does

The **Astronomy Shop** is a fully functional e-commerce application built with microservices. It demonstrates real-world distributed system patterns:
- **Microservice architecture**: 15+ services written in different languages (Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- **Automatic traffic generation**: A load generator continuously simulates user activity—browsing products, adding items to cart, and completing checkouts
- **Distributed communication**: Services communicate via HTTP and gRPC, producing distributed traces that show request flow across the system
- **GenAI observability**: The product reviews feature includes an AI assistant powered by a mock LLM, demonstrating how to capture GenAI semantic conventions (`gen_ai.*` attributes) in traces

### How to access the demo

| Deployment | Demo URL | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Docker | http://localhost:8080 | Frontend of the Astronomy Shop |
| Kubernetes | Depends on your ingress/port-forward setup | Use `kubectl port-forward` if needed |

**Interacting with the shop:**
1. Browse the product catalog
2. Add items to your cart
3. Complete a checkout (use any fake payment details)
> **Note**: The load generator runs automatically in the background. You don't need to manually interact with the shop to generate telemetry—data is already flowing to Elastic.

### What to look at in Elastic

| Where | What to explore |
|-------|-----------------|
| **APM → Services** | See all demo services; click one to explore transactions, latency, throughput, and errors |
| **APM → Service map** | Visualize how services depend on each other; see the request flow architecture |
| **APM → Traces** | View distributed traces; follow a single request across multiple services (e.g., a checkout flow) |
| **APM → Services → product-reviews** | See GenAI/LLM traces with `gen_ai.*` attributes (model, token usage, etc.) |
| **Hosts** | See the host running the demo; explore CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics |
| **Infrastructure → Inventory** | See containers (Docker) or pods/nodes (Kubernetes) |
| **Dashboards → [System] OTel Host Metrics** | Host-level metrics dashboard |
| **Dashboards → [Kubernetes] Cluster Overview** | Kubernetes metrics dashboard (K8s deployments only) |

### What you're seeing

**Traces**
Each user action (browse, add to cart, checkout) generates a distributed trace that spans multiple services. For example, a checkout request flows through:
`frontend → checkout → cart → payment → shipping → email`

**Service map**
Shows the architecture of the demo application:
- Frontend calls product catalog, cart, checkout, recommendation, and product-reviews services
- Checkout orchestrates calls to payment, shipping, and email services
- Product-reviews calls the LLM service for AI-generated review summaries
- All services report to the OpenTelemetry Collector

**Infrastructure metrics**
CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network metrics from the host and containers running the demo services.

**Kubernetes metrics** (K8s deployments only)
Pod, node, and deployment metrics from your cluster, including resource utilization and pod status.

**GenAI/LLM observability**
The product-reviews service calls a mock LLM to generate AI-powered product review summaries. These calls are instrumented using the OpenTelemetry OpenAI instrumentation, which captures GenAI semantic convention attributes:
- `gen_ai.system` — the LLM provider (e.g., `openai`)
- `gen_ai.request.model` — the model used (e.g., `astronomy-llm`)
- `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` / `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` — token consumption
- `gen_ai.response.id` — unique response identifier

To explore: Go to **APM → Services → product-reviews** and look at traces, or use **Discover** with the query `gen_ai.request.model: *` on the `traces-apm*` index.

> **Optional**: To use a real OpenAI-compatible LLM instead of the mock, configure `.env.override`:
> ```
> LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
> LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
> OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
> ```

## Testing with a custom component

Suppose you want to see how your new processor is going to play out in this demo app. You can create a custom OpenTelemetry collector and test it within this demo app by following these steps:
1. Follow the instructions in the [elastic-collector-components](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-collector-components/blob/main/README.md) repo in order to build a Docker image
   that contains your custom component
2. Edit the [deployment.yaml](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml) file:
   - change the `opentelemetry-collector` [image definitions](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L36)
   to point at your custom image repository and tag
   - add your component configuration to the proper sub-section of the [`config` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L62). For example, if you are testing a processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section.
   - add your component to the proper sub-section of the [`service` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L96). For example, if you are testing a logs processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section of the `logs` pipeline.
3. If you wish to enable Kubernetes node level metrics collection, edit the [daemonset.yaml](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/main/kubernetes/elastic-helm/daemonset.yaml) file:
   - change the [`image` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/deployment.yaml#L36)
   to point at your custom image repository and tag
   - add your component configuration to the proper sub-section of the [`config` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/daemonset.yaml#L57). For example, if you are testing a processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section.
   - add your component to the proper sub-section of the [`service` section](https://github.com/elastic/opentelemetry-demo/blob/27b4923ba9acd316d3726a29aad1f7e32299bc8c/kubernetes/elastic-helm/daemonset.yaml#L309). For example, if you are testing a logs processor, make sure to add its config to the `processors` sub-section of the `logs` pipeline.
4. Apply the Helm chart changes and install it:
   ```
   # !(when running it for the first time) add the open-telemetry Helm repostiroy
   helm repo add open-telemetry https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts

   # !(when an older helm open-telemetry repo exists) update the open-telemetry helm repo
   helm repo update open-telemetry

   # deploy the demo through helm install
   helm install -f deployment.yaml my-otel-demo open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo
   ```

## Clean-up 

- **Docker**. Run `./demo.sh destroy docker`
- **Kubernetes**. Run `./demo.sh destroy k8s`
